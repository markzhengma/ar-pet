# To Be With You

## Description

An augmented reality pet game for mental health and education purposes.

## About the Design

The MVP is developed using Unity engine, Firebase, Wikitude augmented reality system and downloaded 3D assets. In our design, users are able to register and login to their own account, which is connected with the Firebase authentication database. After logged in, users would be able to interact with their virtual pet by “placing” them on the surfaces of the real world. This is achieved thanks to the package provided by Wikitude for educational and researching purposes. In the game, users are able to interact with the pet. There are different ways to interact with the pet, but different approaches would lead to different results based on the current status of the pet, for example, if the cat is happy and want to play with the user, feeding him/her might not be a good choice while playing with him/her would result in an increment of intimacy level. Intimacy level is a visible statistic that reflects how close the pet is with the user, higher level would result in boosting user’s level, which is a requirement to unlock different items from the store, and coins, which could be used to buy items, increment. This would help users customize their own pets and develop the close relationship with the pets. The users would also have a chance to interact with other players and their pets, by implementing online server, including chatting and real-time multiplayer, features, gamers community and screenshot sharing functionality. 

The pet’s reaction and approach selections would keep developing in the project, based on the researches on specific animal’s life patterns. Users would look for hints in order to interact with their pets in a better way and repeat this process many times during the gameplay. This makes the application have education potentials and let users feel connected with the pet by attempting, learning, applying and gaining the sense of achievement seeing the virtual character grows together with the pet.
